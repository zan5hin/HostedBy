HostedBy was an exercise in Java programming. It inputs a file containing a set of bookmarks
and performs a whois look up on each unique domain. The hosts are then listed in descending order of popularity.

Crude but effective.

NB: This works with a bookmark file produced by Safari. It has not been tested with any other browser's
bookmark export.
